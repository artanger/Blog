When he built their Cape Cod summer home, Carol insisted on working as hard as her two younger brothers, trying to make equal in her father\'s eyes. A voracious reader, she dreamed of becoming an astronaut and traveling to distant planets; as a teen she even hitchhiked to Cape Canaveral to view a launch there. Her father however, could not accept women as men\'s equals, and when financial troubles meant he could only send one child to college, he chose middle child Steve despite Carol\'s superior grades.She turned 18 just a few months later, and the following day she turned her back on her father and joined the Air Force, intending to be a pilot and to get a college degree via the military. Her brother Steve\'s death in military action would eventually draw Carol back to her family, but she still never felt truly accepted by her father. She quickly rose to the top of her Air Force class, taking the call sign \"Cheeseburger\". While flying an experimental jet through Arabic air space, however, Carol was shot down and captured by a man named Ghazi Rashid, who tortured her for several days. She managed to escape (despite a broken leg and serious injuries), reach a CIA safe-house in the area, and provide key information to the intelligence community. This incident led to her being recruited into Air Force Intelligence.She accomplished many different missions and worked with other figures such as Colonel Nick Fury, Logan (later Wolverine) and Benjamin Grimm (later the Thing), while opposing others such as Victor Creed (later Sabretooth), and Natalia Shostakova (later the Black Widow).','1968-08-05',NULL,NULL,'carol.jpg'),(4,'\"Regimes fall everyday.

Five issues later, she recruits the besotted costumed archer and later superhero Hawkeye to her cause.

The Widow later becomes a recurring ally of the team before officially becoming its sixteenth member many years later.\r\n\r\nThe Black Widow was visually updated in 1970: The Amazing Spider-Man #86 (July 1970) reintroduced her with shoulder-length red hair (instead of her former short black hair), a skintight black costume, and wristbands which fired spider threads. This would become the appearance most commonly associated with the character.\r\n\r\nIn short order, The Black Widow starred in her own series in Amazing Adventures Sept. 1971), sharing that split book with the feature Inhumans.

As the threat of World War II was still escalating, Barnes enlisted in the army to do what he could, only to soon be captured by the forces of HYDRA, however Barnes was eventually rescued by Rogers, who had just become Captain America during Barnes\' absence. Joining forces in the continuing war, Barnes and Rogers formed the Howling Commandos to battle the Red Skull\'s forces. During an attempt to capture HYDRA scientist Arnim Zola, Barnes was caught in an ambush and plummeted from the HYDRA train, where he vanished and was then presumed to be deceased.\r\n\r\nUnbeknownst to his team, Barnes had actually survived the attack on the train, albeit with the loss of his left arm. Brainwashed and armed with a new cybernetic limb, Barnes ultimately became an enhanced HYDRA operative known as the Winter Soldier. Over the next several decades, he would eliminate anyone who posed a threat to HYDRA, including his former ally, Howard Stark as well as his wife Maria. Between his missions, Barnes would be put into a cryogenic stasis to preserve his longevity. Over half a century later, when he was ordered by HYDRA\'s new leader Alexander Pierce to assassinate S.H.I.E.L.D. Director Nick Fury, the Winter Soldier was unexpectedly confronted by his old friend, Steve Rogers, triggering him to begin remembering his prior life before HYDRA.\r\n\r\nIn the wake of the Battle at the Triskelion, the Winter Soldier went on the run from HYDRA onto a mission to remember his past and end his long violent history. However, Barnes was then accused of causing a terrorist bombing, which claimed the life of T\'Chaka, the King of Wakanda, among others.

At Harvard University, the couple participated in an experiment involving hallucinogens.\r\n\r\nThey soon graduated and moved on to Willowdale, Virginia, while working together at Culver University as instructors, where Bruce specialized in Nuclear Physics, Biochemistry, and was a member of the Bio-science Department. Banner met Erik Selvig, one of the university\'s instructors. During that time, Banner was involved in a praised work on anti-electron collisions and Gamma Radiation, becoming one of the foremost geniuses of his entire generation.[6] While working on his gamma ray experiments, Banner was unable to visit his father, and ultimately missed his passing. Throughout his career, Banner obtained seven PhDs.\r\nBanner and Betty Ross were recruited by the United States Armed Forces to work on a top-secret research project under the guise of brand new research of radiation resistance, called the Bio-Tech Force Enhancement Project, a subprogram within Infantry Weapons Development. However, the project\'s true intention was to duplicate the results of Project Rebirth by making Super Soldiers. The project was run under the watch of Thaddeus Ross, the father of Betty.','1962-05-10',NULL,NULL,'hulk.jpg'),(9,'\"If you do this, they will never stop being afraid of you.\" \"I can\'t control their fear.

At the age of ten, while having dinner with her family, a mortar shell hit their apartment building, killing Maximoff\'s parents and trapping her and her brother. A second shell hit the apartment near them but did not go off; the Maximoff twins were left trapped for two days staring at the non exploding shell reading the name on it, Stark Industries.\r\nThis horrifically traumatic experience gave the twins a great hatred for America, especially Tony Stark and later, the Avengers. They often took part and led protests against the Avengers. They dedicated much of their lives to this hatred and began searching for ways to bring down the Avengers. This constant political activity put them on S.H.I.E.L.D. and HYDRA\'s radar.\r\nWhen the twins reached adulthood, Sokovia had become a warzone, with foreign forces invading their streets frequently. Wanda and her brother took part in various riots to drive the foreign forces out of their streets. What the twins did not realize was that the riots were orchestrated by HYDRA, who had taken up residence in the country, using the riots to cover up their experiments. The Maximoffs were approached by List, a scientist at HYDRA , who offered them a way to achieve the power needed to drive war out of Sokovia.\r\nAlthough she was initially skeptical, Wanda was convinced by Pietro to agree to the experiments to gain new powers. Along with other volunteers from the town, Wanda and Pietro underwent a series of tests conducted by Doctor List, where they were exposed to energy from the Scepter, which had fatal effects on all the other volunteers. Wanda and Pietro, however, survived and experienced exceedingly different effects. The power of the scepter then unlocked latent supernatural powers within the pair. Pietro achieved superhuman speed, and Wanda attained a number of mental powers such as telekinesis, hypnosis, and energy projection.','1993-12-23',NULL,NULL,'maximoff.jpg'),(10,'\"Just can\'t seem to miss.\"','Marrying Laura\r\nClinton Barton was born on Thursday, January 7, 1971, in Waverly, Iowa.

Barton would soon come to be one of S.H.I.E.L.D.\'s most elite agents. Of his associates, only Director Nick Fury knew about his relationship with Laura and he excluded her, their future children and the location of their farmhouse from Barton\'s S.H.I.E.L.D. file in order to protect them.

Before Rogers was born, his father Joseph was confirmed to be killed in action in World War I. At a young age he met James \"Bucky\" Barnes, who would eventually become his best friend.\r\nAs a sickly adolescent, Rogers was frequently attacked by bullies on the streets. However, his resilience, despite his small stature, inspired a young James Barnes to come to his aid and fight off the bullies, and the two became good friends.\r\nRogers attended George Washington High School in Brooklyn from 1932 to 1936, and later Auburndale Art School, also in Brooklyn, from 1937 to 1938.\r\nn 1936, Rogers\' mother died of tuberculosis. She was buried next to her husband. After the funeral, Rogers talked to Bucky Barnes, who offered to have Steve stay at his place and do errands to earn his keep, but Rogers declined, saying that he could get by on his own. Barnes told him he didn\'t have to and promised that he would be with him \"\'til the end of the line.\" Rogers held this statement close to heart for years.\r\nWorld War II\r\nThe Brooklyn Dodgers hosted the Philadelphia Phillies at Ebbets Field five times in May, during Major League Baseball\'s 1941 season; Rogers attended at least one of these games and remembered it very well.\r\nRogers and Barnes learned during an art class that the United States of America entered World War II. Rogers wanted to join the United States Army to fight in Europe against the Nazis, so Bucky trained him for two weeks at Goldie\'s Boxing Gym. Soon Bucky and Steve went to a US Recruiting and Induction Center in New York City where Steve was classified as 4F and rejected from service, but Bucky later enlisted in the Army.\r\nIn New York City, December 1941, Steve Rogers continued to be rejected for service in the United States Armed Forces, despite making multiple attempts at different enlistment offices, due to his various health and physical issues. He remained determined to fight alongside his friends and other men in World War II and would attempt to convince the doctors to give him a chance, but to no avail.\r\nDisappointed, he went to a local cinema. At the screening, an advert was played showing the different ways soldiers and civilians can help with the war effort. When a loud jerk in the cinema yelled at the screen and showed disrespect to the message of the film. Rogers was the only person to stand up to the bully, who later brought him outside and then proceeded to beat him up. Steve was later rescued by his friend Bucky Barnes, who chased off the bully.\r\nTraining Begins\r\nRogers agreed and under the supervision of Dr. Erskine, Colonel Chester Phillips and Agent Peggy Carter, he traveled to Camp Lehigh to begin his training. Rogers trained hard but was often mocked and bullied by the other soldiers, including a particularly cruel bully named Gilmore Hodge. Yet his determination and quick thinking often made him stand out from the group. Colonel Phillips was unconvinced of Erskine\'s claims that Rogers was the right person for the procedure but relented after seeing Rogers commit an act of self-sacrificing bravery.\r\nThe night before the treatment, Erskine revealed to Rogers that his first test subject, the Nazi officer Johann Schmidt, underwent an imperfect version of the treatment; becoming super-human but suffering negative side-effects due to his inner ambition for power and obsession with becoming a \"superior man\". However, he reassured Rogers that he chose him because he was inherently a good man and one that because he had been weak his whole life, would not lose respect for the strength he would gain. They promised to share a drink after the treatment.','1918-07-04',NULL,NULL,'cap.jpg'),(12,'\"138 combat missions. That\'s how many I\'ve flown, Tony.

However, as it turned out, Stark was not in attendance. Obadiah Stane instead accepted the award from Rhodes in Stark\'s honor, claiming that Stark would still be working.Rhodes found his friend partying in a casino and scolded him for not attending the award ceremony, Tony Stark denied any knowledge that Rhodes was the one presenting the award. He continued to show little sign of taking anything seriously as he continued to joke, gamble and flirt with the beautiful women around him, even teasing Rhodes by asking him to blow on his dice; before long, Stark had lost his bet and decided to go home.
